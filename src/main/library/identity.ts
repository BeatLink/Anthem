// Resolving what a file is, and which track it belongs to.
//
// Both the gmbrc importer and the filesystem scanner funnel through here, so that running either
// one twice is idempotent and running both does not produce two tracks for one song. The rule is
// deliberately narrow: a file is matched to an existing track only when we can prove it is the same
// file (same path, or same audio content). Guessing that two *different* files are the same
// recording is a separate, reviewable operation — see DESIGN-SPEC §9.2.
